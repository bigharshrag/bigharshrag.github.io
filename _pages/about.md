I am a second year Masters in Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin. I have been working with [Prof. Kristen Grauman](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/) on Audio-Visual Learning from Videos as a part of my masters thesis. Broadly, my research interests are in the area of computer vision and currently I am working on using spatial audio information in 360 videos to extract regions of interest for better audio-visual features.

During the summer of 2020, I interned at Amazon working in the Traffic Mirroring team at AWS.

Before joining UT, I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/). For my undergraduate thesis, I worked at the [Image Analysis and Biometrics Lab](http://www.iab-rubric.org/) at IIITD jointly advised by [Dr. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/) and [Dr. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/). During my undergrad, I also spent summers interning at Goldman Sachs, and CCExtractor for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5348332989841408/).
