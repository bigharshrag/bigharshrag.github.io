I currently work at Amazon Web Services as a Software Engineer. Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin where I worked with [Prof. Kristen Grauman](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/) on Audio-Visual Learning from Videos as a part of my masters thesis. Broadly, my research interests are in the area of computer vision and my most reecent research was on generating better binaural audio from videos.

Before joining UT, I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/). For my undergraduate thesis, I worked at the [Image Analysis and Biometrics Lab](http://www.iab-rubric.org/) at IIITD jointly advised by [Dr. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/) and [Dr. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/).

I also have spent summers interning at Amazon during my masters, and at Goldman Sachs, and CCExtractor for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5348332989841408/) during my undergrad.
