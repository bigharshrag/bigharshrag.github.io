While solving Wordle, after the first couple of guesses, I always want my next guess to use letters I haven't used before, or possibly the ones that are in the incorrect position (and thus marked yellow). However, this strategy sometimes leaves me more stumped than I'd like. I created this tool that allows you to upload a screenshot of your current Wordle state and get a list of potential words using only the valid letters.

I developed this primarily as a thought exercise since I don't actually want to use it during a solve, but it's always fun to look back and see what words I missed when stuck. The primary challenge was figuring out the location of the keyboard and then accurately determining the key colorsâ€”all done in JavaScript on the client side. The final words are sorted based on word rankings from [this great list](https://sonorouschocolate.com/notes/index.php/The_best_strategies_for_Wordle,_part_3_(July_2023)). I've tested this with both light and dark mode screenshots, from the NYT Games app as well as Safari screenshots, but I'm sure it doesn't handle all possible cases.
